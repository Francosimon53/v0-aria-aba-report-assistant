# ABA Therapy Goals for Autism - Best Practices

## Receptive Language Goals

For children ages 3-5 with autism spectrum disorder:

1. Client will respond to 10 different one-step directions with 80% accuracy across 3 consecutive sessions.
   - Example directions: "come here", "sit down", "give me", "stand up"
   - Measured through direct observation
   - Parent training included

2. Client will identify 20 common objects when named by instructor with 90% accuracy.
   - Objects should be functional and age-appropriate
   - Use errorless teaching initially
   - Fade prompts systematically

3. Client will follow 2-step directions without prompts in 4 out of 5 opportunities.
   - Example: "Get your shoes and come here"
   - Practice in natural environment
   - Generalize across settings
