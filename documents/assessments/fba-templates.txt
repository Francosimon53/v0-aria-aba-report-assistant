# Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA) Templates

## FBA Overview and Purpose

A Functional Behavior Assessment is a systematic process for identifying the variables that reliably predict and maintain problem behavior.

## Components of a Comprehensive FBA

### 1. Reason for Referral
[Client Name] was referred for a Functional Behavior Assessment due to [specific behaviors] that are impacting [areas of functioning]. The behaviors have been occurring for approximately [duration].

### 2. Operational Behavior Definitions

Physical Aggression:
Any instance of making forceful physical contact with another person using hands, feet, head, or objects. Includes hitting, kicking, biting, scratching, pinching, head-butting, hair pulling, pushing, and throwing objects at others.

Self-Injurious Behavior (SIB):
Any instance of self-directed physical contact that causes or has potential to cause tissue damage. Includes head hitting, self-biting, self-scratching, face slapping, and skin picking.

Elopement:
Any instance of leaving or attempting to leave a designated area without permission. Includes running away, leaving classroom without permission, exiting home without caregiver knowledge.

Property Destruction:
Any instance of causing damage to objects or property. Includes breaking items, tearing materials, throwing objects forcefully, kicking furniture.

Tantrum Behavior:
Combination of two or more: crying/screaming above conversational volume, falling to floor, flailing limbs while crying.

Non-Compliance:
Failure to initiate response to instruction within 10 seconds, or failure to complete ongoing task.

### 3. Indirect Assessment Methods

Parent Interview Questions:
- Describe the behavior in detail
- How often does it occur?
- When is it most/least likely to occur?
- Who is present when it occurs?
- What happens right before?
- What happens right after?
- What calms the client down?
- What interventions have been tried?

Standardized Tools:
- FAST (Functional Assessment Screening Tool)
- MAS (Motivational Assessment Scale)
- QABF (Questions About Behavioral Function)

### 4. ABC Data Collection

Record for each instance:
- Date and time
- Setting/Activity
- People present
- Antecedent (what happened before)
- Behavior (specific description)
- Consequence (what happened after)
- Possible function

### 5. The Four Functions of Behavior

ESCAPE/AVOIDANCE:
- Occurs during/after demands
- Results in removal of demands
- Decreases when demands removed

ATTENTION:
- Occurs when attention diverted
- Results in attention from others
- Decreases with continuous attention

TANGIBLE:
- Occurs when items unavailable
- Results in access to items
- Does not occur when items freely available

AUTOMATIC/SENSORY:
- Occurs across all conditions
- Occurs when alone
- Produces sensory input

### 6. FBA Summary Statement Template

Based on the Functional Behavior Assessment, [behavior] is most likely maintained by [function]. The behavior is most likely to occur when [antecedent conditions] and is less likely when [protective factors]. Setting events include [setting events]. When the behavior occurs, it results in [consequence], which reinforces the behavior through [reinforcement mechanism].

### 7. Insurance Documentation Requirements

FBA Must Include:
- Clear reason for assessment
- Operational definitions of target behaviors
- Multiple assessment methods used
- Data supporting function determination
- Clear summary statement
- Recommendations linked to function
- BCBA signature and credentials
- Date of assessment
