# Standardized ABA Assessments Guide

## VB-MAPP (Verbal Behavior Milestones Assessment and Placement Program)

### Overview
Criterion-referenced assessment for language, learning, and social skills. Based on Skinner's analysis of verbal behavior. 170 milestones across 3 levels.

### Levels

Level 1 (0-18 months skills):
Mand, Tact, Echoic, Listener Responding, Visual Perceptual/MTS, Independent Play, Social Behavior, Motor Imitation, Vocal Play

Level 2 (18-30 months skills):
Above plus LRFFC, Intraverbal, Classroom Routines, Linguistic Structure

Level 3 (30-48 months skills):
Above plus Reading, Writing, Math

### Barriers Assessment
24 barriers that impede learning:
Negative behaviors, instructional control issues, weak mand/tact/echoic repertoires, prompt dependency, scrolling, impaired scanning, failure to generalize, weak motivators, self-stimulation, articulation problems, obsessive-compulsive behavior, hyperactivity, poor eye contact, sensory defensiveness

### VB-MAPP Goals by Domain

Mand:
- Level 1: Mand for 10 items with sign/PECS/vocal
- Level 2: Mand using 2-word phrases for 25 items
- Level 3: Mand for information using wh-questions

Tact:
- Level 1: Tact 25 common objects
- Level 2: Tact 200 items including verbs/adjectives
- Level 3: Tact using complete sentences

Listener Responding:
- Level 1: Follow 10 motor instructions
- Level 2: Select items by LRFFC
- Level 3: Follow 3-step unrelated instructions

D. Motor Imitation (20 items)
E. Vocal Imitation (10 items)
F. Requests/Mands (24 items)
G. Labeling/Tacts (49 items)
H. Intraverbals (62 items)
I. Spontaneous Vocalizations (10 items)
J. Syntax and Grammar (22 items)

Academic/Self-Help:

L. Social Interaction (34 items)
M. Group Instruction (14 items)
N. Classroom Routines (14 items)
O-R. Self-Help Skills
S-V. Academics (Reading, Math, Writing, Spelling)

### Scoring
0 = Not present
1 = Emerging (full prompt)
2 = Partial (partial prompt)
3 = Present (independent, familiar)
4 = Mastered (generalized, fluent)

## Vineland-3 (Adaptive Behavior Scales)

### Domains

Communication:
- Receptive
- Expressive
- Written

Daily Living Skills:
- Personal
- Domestic
- Community

Socialization:
- Interpersonal Relationships
- Play and Leisure
- Coping Skills

Motor Skills (birth-9 years):
- Gross Motor
- Fine Motor

### Standard Score Interpretation
130+: Very High
115-129: High
86-114: Average
71-85: Low
70 and below: Very Low

### Using Vineland for Treatment Planning

Communication < 85: Target receptive/expressive language, consider AAC
Daily Living < 85: Target self-care, domestic, safety skills
Socialization < 85: Target social interaction, play, peer relationships
Motor < 85: Consider OT/PT referral, include motor imitation

## Assessment Schedule

- Initial: Full battery before treatment
- Ongoing: VB-MAPP/ABLLS-R quarterly
- Annual: Vineland-3 for progress monitoring
- As needed: FBA when new behaviors emerge

## Converting Assessments to Goals

From VB-MAPP:
- Score 0: Not current target (prerequisites needed)
- Score 1: Acquisition target
- Score 2-3: Fluency/generalization target
- Score 4-5: Mastered (maintenance)

From Vineland-3:
- Domain < 70: Intensive intervention
- Domain 70-85: Targeted intervention
- Domain > 85: Monitor and support
