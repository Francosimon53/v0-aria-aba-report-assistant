# Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP) Templates

## Required BIP Components

### 1. Target Behavior Summary
- Operational definition from FBA
- Baseline data
- Identified function
- Summary statement

### 2. Behavior Goals Template
[Client] will reduce [target behavior] from baseline of [current level] to [goal level] as measured by [data collection method] over [timeframe].

## Function-Based Interventions

### ESCAPE-MAINTAINED BEHAVIOR

Antecedent Strategies:
- Demand fading (start easy, gradually increase)
- Choice making within tasks
- High-probability request sequence
- Task modification and breaks
- Visual schedules for predictability

Replacement Behavior (FCT):
Teach appropriate break request: "Break please," break card, or sign for "all done"

Consequence Strategies:
- Do NOT remove demand after problem behavior
- Use escape extinction
- Provide break only after appropriate request or task completion

### ATTENTION-MAINTAINED BEHAVIOR

Antecedent Strategies:
- Noncontingent attention on schedule
- Scheduled check-ins
- Position client near adult
- Visual timer for when attention available

Replacement Behavior (FCT):
Teach appropriate attention request: "Excuse me," tap shoulder, raise hand

Consequence Strategies:
- Minimize attention for problem behavior
- Planned ignoring when safe
- Enthusiastic attention for appropriate requests

### TANGIBLE-MAINTAINED BEHAVIOR

Antecedent Strategies:
- Noncontingent access to preferred items
- Visual schedules showing when items available
- First-Then boards
- Transition warnings with timer

Replacement Behavior (FCT):
Teach appropriate requesting: "Can I have ___?" or picture exchange

Consequence Strategies:
- Do NOT provide item after problem behavior
- Immediate access for appropriate requests
- Teach waiting and accepting "no"

### AUTOMATIC/SENSORY-MAINTAINED BEHAVIOR

Antecedent Strategies:
- Environmental enrichment
- Matched stimulation (alternative with similar sensory properties)
- Antecedent exercise
- Sensory diet throughout day

Replacement Behavior:
Teach appropriate alternative sensory behavior

Consequence Strategies:
- Response interruption and redirection (RIRD)
- Reinforce engagement with alternatives

## Crisis Intervention Plan

Include for dangerous behaviors:
1. Warning signs/precursor behaviors
2. De-escalation strategies
3. Safety procedures
4. Post-crisis procedures
5. Documentation requirements

## Data Collection Plan

Track:
- Frequency/duration of target behavior
- Replacement behavior use
- Treatment fidelity
- Progress toward goals

## BIP Review Schedule

- Ongoing review: Monthly
- Comprehensive review: Quarterly

## Insurance Requirements

BIP Must Include:
- Link to FBA with identified function
- Measurable behavior goals
- Function-based interventions
- Replacement behavior training
- Data collection plan
