# ABA Intervention Procedures - Evidence-Based Practices

## Discrete Trial Training (DTT)

### Definition
Discrete Trial Training is a structured teaching methodology that breaks skills into small, distinct elements and teaches each element systematically through repeated trials.

### Components of a Discrete Trial
1. Discriminative Stimulus (SD): Clear instruction or cue
2. Prompt: Assistance provided if needed
3. Response: Client's behavior
4. Consequence: Reinforcement or correction
5. Inter-Trial Interval: Brief pause between trials

### Implementation Guidelines
- Present SD clearly and consistently
- Wait 3-5 seconds for response (response interval)
- Deliver reinforcement immediately (within 1-2 seconds)
- Use error correction procedure for incorrect responses
- Maintain 80% known to 20% unknown ratio for motivation
- Conduct 10-20 trials per target per session
- Randomize target presentation to prevent rote responding

### Data Collection for DTT
- Record correct/incorrect for each trial
- Note prompt level used
- Track first-trial correct responses
- Calculate daily percentage correct

### Error Correction Procedure
1. Remove materials, provide brief feedback ("Let's try again")
2. Re-present SD with prompt at level needed for success
3. Reinforce prompted correct response (lower magnitude)
4. Re-present SD independently
5. Reinforce independent correct response (full magnitude)

## Natural Environment Teaching (NET)

### Definition
Natural Environment Teaching uses the natural environment and client motivation to teach skills in context where they will naturally occur.

### Key Characteristics
- Child-led, following client's motivation
- Teaching occurs during naturally occurring opportunities
- Skills taught in context of use
- Reinforcement is natural consequence when possible
- More closely resembles typical learning

### Implementation Guidelines
- Arrange environment to create teaching opportunities
- Follow client's lead and interests
- Capture motivation in the moment
- Embed trials within play activities
- Use natural reinforcers when possible
- Vary teaching locations and materials
- Fade to natural cues and consequences

### NET Procedures
1. Observe what client is interested in
2. Create or capture teaching opportunity
3. Provide SD related to motivating item/activity
4. Prompt as needed
5. Deliver natural reinforcer (access to item/activity)
6. Expand on response when appropriate

## Prompting Strategies

### Prompt Hierarchy (Least to Most)
1. Independent (no prompt)
2. Gestural (point, head nod)
3. Positional (move correct item closer)
4. Verbal (partial or full verbal cue)
5. Model (demonstrate correct response)
6. Partial Physical (light touch guidance)
7. Full Physical (hand-over-hand)

### Prompt Hierarchy (Most to Least)
1. Full Physical
2. Partial Physical
3. Model
4. Verbal
5. Gestural
6. Independent

### Prompt Fading Guidelines
- Fade prompts as quickly as possible
- Use least intrusive prompt needed
- Avoid prompt dependency
- Plan systematic fading from the start
- Monitor for prompt dependency signs
- Use time delay procedures when appropriate

### Time Delay Procedures

Progressive Time Delay:
- Start with 0-second delay (immediate prompt)
- Increase delay by 1-2 seconds each session
- Continue until target delay reached (usually 4-5 seconds)

Constant Time Delay:
- Start with 0-second delay for initial sessions
- Move to constant delay (e.g., 4 seconds) for all subsequent sessions

## Reinforcement Procedures

### Types of Reinforcement
- Primary: Food, drink, sensory items
- Secondary: Tokens, praise, activities
- Social: Attention, praise, high-fives
- Activity: Preferred activities, free time
- Tangible: Toys, stickers, preferred items

### Reinforcement Schedules

Continuous (CRF):
- Reinforce every correct response
- Use during acquisition of new skills
- Produces rapid learning

Fixed Ratio (FR):
- Reinforce after set number of responses
- FR-1 is continuous, FR-5 is every 5 responses
- Use to build response persistence

Variable Ratio (VR):
- Reinforce after average number of responses
- VR-5 averages every 5 responses
- Produces steady, high rates of responding
- Resistant to extinction

Fixed Interval (FI):
- Reinforce first response after set time
- Use for duration-based skills

Variable Interval (VI):
- Reinforce first response after average time
- Produces steady, moderate rates

### Reinforcement Guidelines
- Conduct regular preference assessments
- Vary reinforcers to prevent satiation
- Match reinforcement magnitude to task difficulty
- Fade to natural reinforcement when possible
- Pair primary with social reinforcement
- Use differential reinforcement (more for better responses)

## Behavior Reduction Procedures

### Differential Reinforcement

DRA (Differential Reinforcement of Alternative Behavior):
- Reinforce a specific alternative behavior
- Alternative should serve same function
- Place problem behavior on extinction when safe

DRI (Differential Reinforcement of Incompatible Behavior):
- Reinforce behavior physically incompatible with problem behavior
- Example: Reinforce hands in lap instead of hitting

DRO (Differential Reinforcement of Other Behavior):
- Reinforce absence of problem behavior for set interval
- Start with achievable intervals
- Gradually increase interval length

DRL (Differential Reinforcement of Low Rates):
- Reinforce when behavior occurs less frequently
- Set criterion slightly below baseline
- Gradually decrease criterion

### Extinction
- Withhold reinforcement that maintains problem behavior
- Must identify function first via FBA
- Expect extinction burst initially
- Be prepared for spontaneous recovery
- Combine with reinforcement of alternatives
- Not appropriate for all behaviors (e.g., dangerous SIB)

### Antecedent Interventions

Environmental Modifications:
- Remove triggers when possible
- Increase structure and predictability
- Provide choices
- Use visual schedules
- Reduce demands during high-stress times

Noncontingent Reinforcement (NCR):
- Provide reinforcement on time-based schedule
- Independent of behavior
- Reduces motivation for problem behavior
- Gradually thin schedule over time

High-Probability Request Sequence:
- Present series of easy requests (high-p)
- Follow with target request (low-p)
- Builds behavioral momentum
- Increases compliance

## Generalization Procedures

### Strategies for Generalization
1. Train sufficient exemplars (multiple examples)
2. Train loosely (vary non-critical aspects)
3. Program common stimuli
4. Mediate generalization (teach self-instruction)
5. Train to generalize (reinforce generalization)
6. Use multiple trainers
7. Use multiple settings
8. Use multiple materials

### Maintenance Procedures
- Gradually thin reinforcement schedules
- Transfer to natural reinforcers
- Conduct periodic maintenance probes
- Retrain if skills deteriorate
- Involve caregivers in maintenance
