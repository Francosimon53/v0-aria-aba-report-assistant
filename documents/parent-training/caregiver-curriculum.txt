### Content

What is Autism Spectrum Disorder?
Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by:
- Differences in social communication and interaction
- Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior or interests
- Symptoms present in early developmental period
- Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment

What is Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)?
ABA is the science of behavior that:
- Uses systematic teaching methods based on learning principles
- Focuses on socially significant behaviors
- Relies on data to guide treatment decisions
- Has over 50 years of research supporting its effectiveness

Why is Parent Involvement Critical?
Research shows that parent involvement in ABA therapy:
- Improves generalization of skills to home settings
- Increases maintenance of learned skills over time
- Reduces problem behaviors across all environments
- Leads to better overall treatment outcomes
- Decreases family stress and improves quality of life

### Competency Check
- Caregiver can describe 3 characteristics of autism
- Caregiver can explain what ABA therapy involves
- Caregiver can state 2 reasons why their involvement matters

## Module 2: Reinforcement Fundamentals

### Learning Objectives
- Define positive reinforcement
- Identify effective reinforcers for your child
- Deliver reinforcement effectively
- Avoid common reinforcement mistakes

### Content

What is Positive Reinforcement?
Positive reinforcement occurs when:
- A behavior is followed by addition of something
- The behavior increases in the future
- Example: Child says "cookie," gets cookie, asks more often

Types of Reinforcers:
- Edibles: Snacks, treats, drinks
- Tangibles: Toys, stickers, preferred items
- Activities: iPad time, playground, preferred games
- Social: Praise, hugs, high-fives, attention
- Sensory: Items providing preferred sensory input

How to Identify Reinforcers:
- Observe what your child chooses during free time
- Notice what they request or reach for
- Ask them what they want to work for
- Try different items and see what motivates them
- Remember: Reinforcers change - reassess regularly

Effective Reinforcement Delivery:
- Immediate: Within 1-3 seconds of the behavior
- Contingent: Only given after the target behavior
- Specific: Pair with specific praise ("Great job saying 'cookie'!")
- Enthusiastic: Match your energy to what motivates your child
- Varied: Rotate reinforcers to prevent satiation

Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- Giving reinforcer before the behavior
- Waiting too long to deliver reinforcement
- Giving reinforcement for free (not contingent)
- Using the same reinforcer until child is bored
- Accidentally reinforcing problem behaviors

### Practice Activities
- Create a list of 10 potential reinforcers for your child
- Practice delivering reinforcement within 3 seconds
- Track which reinforcers are most effective this week

### Competency Check
- Caregiver can define positive reinforcement
- Caregiver can list 5 reinforcers for their child

- Caregiver can identify 2 reinforcement mistakes

## Module 3: Giving Effective Instructions

### Learning Objectives
- Deliver clear, effective instructions
- Gain your child's attention before giving instructions
- Use appropriate wait time
- Avoid repeating instructions multiple times

### Content

Components of Effective Instructions:
- Get attention first (say name, wait for eye contact or orientation)
- Be close to your child (within arm's reach)
- Use clear, simple language
- State what TO do (not what not to do)
- Give one instruction at a time
- Use a neutral, matter-of-fact tone

Examples:
- Instead of: "Don't run!" → Say: "Walk"
- Instead of: "Stop making noise!" → Say: "Quiet voice"
- Instead of: "Can you put your shoes on?" → Say: "Put on shoes"

The Three-Step Prompting Procedure:
1. Give instruction, wait 5 seconds
2. If no response: Repeat instruction + gestural prompt, wait 5 seconds
3. If no response: Repeat instruction + physical guidance

Important Rules:
- Say it once, then prompt (don't repeat 10 times)
- Always follow through
- Reinforce compliance enthusiastically
- Stay calm and neutral during prompting

### Practice Activities
- Practice giving 10 clear instructions per day
- Use the 3-step prompting procedure

## Module 4: Prompting and Prompt Fading

### Learning Objectives
- Understand different types of prompts
- Use the least intrusive prompt necessary
- Systematically fade prompts over time
- Avoid prompt dependency

### Content

Types of Prompts (Least to Most Intrusive):
1. Gestural: Pointing, nodding, looking at correct answer
2. Verbal: Telling them what to do or giving a hint
3. Model: Showing them what to do
4. Partial Physical: Light touch to guide
5. Full Physical: Hand-over-hand assistance

Prompt Fading Strategies:
- Most-to-Least: Start with full help, gradually reduce
- Least-to-Most: Start with no help, add only if needed
- Time Delay: Wait longer before prompting each time

Signs of Prompt Dependency:
- Child waits for prompt before responding
- Child looks to adult before attempting
- Child only performs with specific person
- No improvement in independence over time

How to Avoid Prompt Dependency:
- Fade prompts as quickly as possible
- Use the least intrusive prompt that works
- Vary who provides instruction
- Reinforce independence more than prompted responses
- Build in independent opportunities

### Practice Activities
- Identify the prompt level your child typically needs
- Practice fading prompts by one level
- Reinforce any independent attempts enthusiastically

### Competency Check
- Caregiver can name 4 types of prompts
- Caregiver uses least-to-most prompting correctly
- Caregiver can identify signs of prompt dependency
- Caregiver demonstrates prompt fading

## Module 5: Managing Problem Behaviors

### Learning Objectives
- Understand why problem behaviors occur
- Identify the function of your child's behavior
- Respond appropriately to problem behaviors
- Reinforce appropriate alternative behaviors

### Content

The Four Functions of Behavior:
All behavior serves a purpose. The four functions are:

1. Escape/Avoidance: Behavior to get away from something
   - Signs: Occurs during demands, non-preferred activities
   - Example: Tantrum when asked to do homework

2. Attention: Behavior to get attention from others
   - Signs: Occurs when adult is busy, looks at adult during behavior
   - Example: Yelling when parent is on the phone

3. Access to Tangibles: Behavior to get items or activities
   - Signs: Occurs when denied something wanted
   - Example: Hitting when told "no" to candy

4. Automatic/Sensory: Behavior that feels good itself
   - Signs: Occurs when alone, no clear trigger
   - Example: Hand flapping, spinning objects

Responding Based on Function:

For Escape-Maintained Behavior:
- Don't let the behavior result in escape
- Prompt completion of task
- Make tasks more manageable
- Reinforce completing tasks

For Attention-Maintained Behavior:
- Minimize attention to problem behavior
- Give lots of attention for appropriate behavior
- Teach appropriate ways to request attention

For Tangible-Maintained Behavior:
- Don't give the item following problem behavior
- Teach appropriate requesting
- Provide access for appropriate behavior

For Automatic Behavior:
- Provide alternative sensory input
- Redirect to appropriate activities
- Consult with BCBA for specific strategies

General Guidelines:
- Stay calm (don't show frustration)
- Be consistent every time
- Safety first - block dangerous behaviors
- Contact BCBA if behavior is severe or not improving

### Practice Activities
- Identify the likely function of your child's top problem behavior
- Practice staying calm during a challenging moment
- Reinforce appropriate behavior 5 times for every correction

### Competency Check
- Caregiver can name the 4 functions of behavior
- Caregiver can identify their child's behavior function

- Shape toward clearer communication

Responding to Communication:
- Honor ALL communication attempts
- Respond immediately with the requested item
- Praise the communication attempt
- Don't require perfect speech to respond
- Model correct form without demanding repetition

Expanding Communication:
- Add one word to child's utterance

- Model during natural opportunities
- Read books and label pictures
- Narrate daily activities

### Practice Activities
- Create 5 communication opportunities daily
- Respond to every communication attempt immediately
- Model expanded language 10 times per day

### Competency Check
- Caregiver creates communication opportunities

## Module 7: Generalization and Maintenance

### Learning Objectives
- Understand why skills must generalize
- Promote skill use across settings and people
- Maintain learned skills over time
- Partner with the therapy team

### Content

What is Generalization?
Generalization means using learned skills:
- In different places (therapy, home, school, community)
- With different people (therapists, parents, teachers, peers)
- With different materials (various toys, foods, items)
- At different times (morning, afternoon, evening)

Why Generalization is Challenging for Children with Autism:
- May learn skills in narrow contexts
- Difficulty recognizing when to use skills
- Need explicit teaching across settings
- Require many examples to generalize

How Parents Promote Generalization:
- Practice therapy goals at home
- Use same language/procedures as therapists
- Create opportunities in daily routines
- Take skills into the community
- Involve siblings and other family members

Maintaining Skills Over Time:
- Continue practicing learned skills
- Use skills in meaningful daily activities
- Periodically check on previously mastered skills
- Inform BCBA if skills seem to be declining
- Gradually reduce prompts and reinforcement

Partnering with the Therapy Team:
- Attend team meetings when possible
- Communicate successes and challenges
- Share what works at home
- Ask questions about goals and procedures
- Report any concerns immediately

### Practice Activities
- Practice one therapy goal in a new location this week
- Involve one new person in practicing skills
- Check on a previously mastered skill

### Competency Check
- Caregiver can explain why generalization matters
- Caregiver practices goals in multiple settings
- Caregiver involves multiple people in teaching
- Caregiver communicates regularly with therapy team

## Module 8: Data Collection Basics

### Learning Objectives

Yes/No Tracking:
- Did the child do the skill today? Yes or No
- Simple for daily routines
- Example: Did child brush teeth independently? Y/N

Rating Scale:
- Rate the day/behavior on a scale
- Example: 1=Very difficult, 5=Great day
- Quick way to see trends

Duration:
- How long did the behavior last?
- Use a timer or phone
- Example: Minutes of tantrum

Tips for Home Data Collection:
- Keep it simple
- Build into existing routines
- Use technology (apps, notes on phone)
- Aim for consistency over perfection
- Share data weekly with therapy team

### Practice Activities
