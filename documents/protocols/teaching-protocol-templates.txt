### Materials Needed
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]
- [Item 3]

### Teaching Procedure

Antecedent (SD):
[Exact instruction or cue to be given]
Example: "Touch [item]" or "What is this?"

Response:
[Description of correct response]
Example: Client touches the named item within 5 seconds

Consequence for Correct Response:
- Deliver reinforcement immediately (within 1-2 seconds)
- Provide specific praise: "[Great job/Nice work] touching [item]!"
- Record "+" on data sheet

Consequence for Incorrect/No Response:
1. Remove materials, provide neutral feedback ("Let's try again")
2. Re-present SD with [prompt level] prompt
3. Reinforce prompted correct response (reduced magnitude)
4. Re-present SD with [lower prompt/independent]
5. Reinforce and record prompt level used

### Prompt Hierarchy
1. Independent (I) - No prompt
2. Gestural (G) - Point to correct answer
3. Verbal (V) - Say the answer or give hint
4. Model (M) - Demonstrate correct response
5. Partial Physical (PP) - Light touch guidance
6. Full Physical (FP) - Hand-over-hand

### Prompt Fading Plan
- Begin at [prompt level]
- Fade to next level after [X] consecutive correct at current level
- Use progressive time delay: Start 0 sec, increase by 2 sec each session

### Mastery Criteria
[X]% accuracy across [X] consecutive sessions with at least [X] different therapists

### Generalization Plan
- Teach with multiple exemplars: [list variations]
- Practice in multiple settings: [list locations]
- Practice with multiple people: [list therapists/caregivers]

### Data Collection
- Trial-by-trial data
- Record: Correct (+), Incorrect (-), Prompted (note level)

## Natural Environment Teaching (NET) Protocol Template

### Target Skill: [Skill Name]
Domain: [Communication/Social/Adaptive]
Functional Context: [When/why child would naturally use this skill]

### Operational Definition
[Clear description of target behavior in natural context]

### Environment Setup
Motivation: [How to capture/contrive motivation]
Materials: [Items needed to create teaching opportunities]
Setting: [Where teaching will occur]

### Teaching Procedure

Creating the Opportunity:
1. Observe child's current interest/motivation
2. [Specific strategy to create teaching opportunity]
3. Wait expectantly for response

Providing the SD:
[Natural cue or created opportunity]
Example: Hold up desired item, wait expectantly, ask "What do you want?"

Target Response:
[Expected response within natural context]
Example: Child says "ball" or "I want ball"

Consequence:
- Immediately provide natural reinforcer (access to item/activity)
- Pair with social reinforcement: "You said ball! Here's the ball!"
- Expand language model: "You want the RED ball!"

Prompting in NET:
- Use least intrusive prompt
- Prompt within the natural interaction
- Fade prompts quickly to maintain natural feel
- Model > Verbal > Gestural preferred over physical

### Embedding Opportunities
- Minimum [X] opportunities per hour during NET sessions
- Target across daily routines: [meals, play, transitions, etc.]
- Capture naturally occurring opportunities when possible

### Data Collection
- Frequency count of opportunities and responses
- Note: Independent, Prompted, or No Response
- Track generalization across settings/people

### Mastery Criteria
[X] independent responses across [X] different activities/settings

Current Level: [Baseline - which steps independent vs. prompted]

### Operational Definition
[Description of complete routine from start to finish]

### Task Analysis Steps

| Step # | Step Description | Prompt Level Needed |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | [First step] | |
| 2 | [Second step] | |
| 3 | [Third step] | |
| 4 | [Fourth step] | |
| 5 | [Fifth step] | |
| 6 | [Sixth step] | |
| 7 | [Seventh step] | |
| 8 | [Eighth step] | |

### Teaching Procedure

Chaining Method: [Forward Chain / Backward Chain / Total Task]

Forward Chaining:
- Teach Step 1 to mastery, prompt remaining steps
- Add Step 2, teach to mastery, prompt remaining
- Continue until all steps independent

Backward Chaining:
- Prompt all steps except last step
- Teach last step to mastery
- Add second-to-last step
- Continue backward until all steps independent

Total Task:
- Teach all steps each trial
- Provide prompts as needed for each step
- Fade prompts for all steps simultaneously

### Prompting
- Use least-to-most prompting within each step
- Record prompt level needed for each step
- Fade prompts systematically

### Reinforcement
- Reinforce completion of target step(s) being taught
- Use natural reinforcer when possible (completion of routine)
- Pair with social praise

### Mastery Criteria
100% of steps independent across [3-5] consecutive opportunities

### Data Collection
- Record prompt level for each step each trial
- Calculate percentage of steps independent
- Graph progress weekly

## Social Skills Protocol Template

### Target Skill: [Social Skill Name]
